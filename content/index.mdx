## History of ceramics in China 

The history of Chinese ceramics can be traced back to over ten thousand years ago. During the Yangshao culture of the Neolithic age, earthenware with color decoration as well as red or white-bodied ware were made, and later in the Longshan culture, production of black ware flourished. 

In the Shang dynasty, ash-glazed ware which are also known as proto celadon began to appear and from the end of the Spring and Autumn period to the Warring States period, hard-bodied, high-fired pottery with impressed decoration and ash-glazed ware were fired. 

By the Warring States period, gray ware with or without color decoration were produced in large quantities, one of the leading examples being the terracotta warriors excavated from the tomb of Emperor Qin Shihuangdi.

## Celadon  

China produced many types of green-glazed wares, in shades ranging from olive to grass to grey-blue. Resembling jade, they were admired for their tranquil beauty. They were often used in Buddhist tea ceremonies and meditation rituals.

Although some were made in northern China, green-glazed wares remained a speciality of the south; this dish was produced at the Longquan kilns of Zhejiang province. Green-glazed vessels were exported in large quantities to South-east Asia and the Middle East. Later European collectors gave these wares the fanciful name of ‘celadon’.
